# What Is the `toString()` Method, and How Does It Work?

The `toString()` method is a fundamental feature in JavaScript that converts a value to its string representation. It's a method you can use for numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

One of the most common uses of `toString()` is to convert a number to its string representation. Here's an example:

```javascript
const num = 10;
console.log(num.toString()); // "10"
```

This method accepts an optional `radix`, which is a number from `2` to `36`. This radix represents the base, such as base `2` for binary or base `8` for octal. If the radix is not specified, it defaults to base `10`, which is decimal. Here's an example of passing `2` as an argument to the `toString()` method:

```javascript
const num = 10;
console.log(num.toString(2)); // "1010"
```

The result will be `"1010"`, which is the binary representation of the decimal number `10`.

You can also use the `toString()` method to convert arrays and objects to strings. Arrays have a custom implementation of `toString()` that converts each element to a string and joins them with commas. Here's an example:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(arr.toString()); // "1,2,3"
```

In this example, all the elements of the array are joined together to form the string `"1,2,3"`.

When the `toString()` method is used with objects, the result will not be a stringified version of the object properties.

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: true
};

console.log(person.toString()); // "[object Object]"
```

In this example, the result will be the default string representation for the object, which is `"[object Object]"`. To get a stringified version of the `person` object properties, you'll need to use `JSON.stringify()`, which you will learn more about in future lessons.

## Conclusion

The `toString()` method is used for converting values to strings. Understanding how it works with different data types and how it differs from `JSON.stringify()` will help you manipulate and display data more effectively in your JavaScript applications.
