# What Are Static Properties and Methods in Classes?

Static properties and methods belong to the class itself, not to the individual instances of the class. You can access them directly on the class name without creating an instance of the class. They are defined within classes to encapsulate related functionality.

## Defining and Calling Static Methods

You can define a static method by writing the `static` keyword before the name of the method.

`class MyClass {
  static staticMethod() { ... }
}`

Then, you can call the static method on the class directly, using dot notation and passing any necessary arguments:

`MyClass.staticMethod();`

Notice that you are able to call the method without creating an instance of the class. That's one of the key characteristics of static methods.

## Comparing Movies with a Static Method

Here's an example. Let's say that we are creating a movies application and we want to be able to compare movies based on their rating.

We could consider this comparison method as a higher level method that is not specific to any movie:

`if (movieA.rating < movieB.rating) {
  console.log(\`${movieB.title} has a higher rating.\`);
}`

It's like a more general method related to the `Movie` class.

For readability and maintainability purposes, it would be helpful to define it within the `Movie` class to keep all related methods relatively close to each other.

Therefore, this is a perfect candidate for a static method. You can see it here, just below the constructor:

`class Movie {

  constructor(title, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.rating = rating;
  }

  static compareMovies(movieA, movieB) {
    if (movieA.rating > movieB.rating) {
      console.log(\`${movieA.title} has a higher rating.\`);
    } else if (movieA.rating < movieB.rating) {
      console.log(\`${movieB.title} has a higher rating.\`);
    } else {
      console.log("These movies have the same rating.");
    }
  }

}

let movieA = new Movie("Movie A", 80);
let movieB = new Movie("Movie B", 45);

console.log(movieA);`

The static method is defined with the `static` keyword and it's called `compareMovies`. It has two parameters: `movieA` and `movieB`. These will be instances of the `Movie` class.

We will compare them based on their rating, on a range from `0` to `100`. This logic is implemented with a conditional and it will print an appropriate message based on which movie has a higher rating.

Once the method has been defined, you can call it on the class. But first, you need to have the arguments ready and defined in your program.

In this case, the method takes two movie instances as arguments, so we define these instances here:

`let movieA = new Movie("Movie A", 80);
let movieB = new Movie("Movie B", 45);`

You can see that `movieA` has a higher rating than `movieB`. Let's see the output of this method.

To call the method, you just need to use dot notation on the class itself. You write the name of the class (`Movie`), followed by a dot, and then the name of the static method (`compareMovies`).

Then, you pass the arguments within parentheses. In this case, they are the two movie instances that the method requires.

`Movie.compareMovies(movieA, movieB);`

Here is the updated example:

`class Movie {

  constructor(title, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.rating = rating;
  }

  static compareMovies(movieA, movieB) {
    if (movieA.rating > movieB.rating) {
      console.log(\`${movieA.title} has a higher rating.\`);
    } else if (movieA.rating < movieB.rating) {
      console.log(\`${movieB.title} has a higher rating.\`);
    } else {
      console.log("These movies have the same rating.");
    }
  }

}

let movieA = new Movie("Movie A", 80);
let movieB = new Movie("Movie B", 45);

Movie.compareMovies(movieA, movieB);

console.log(movieA);`

## Creating Objects with Factory Methods

Static methods are also helpful for implementing "factory" methods. A factory method is a method that you define in addition to the constructor to create objects based on specific criteria.

Here's an example with a `Pizza` class. The static method `createMargherita` is a factory method that you can call to create a Margherita pizza instance with its type and price already set.

`class Pizza {
  constructor(type, price) {
    this.type = type;
    this.price = price;
  }

  static createMargherita() {
    return new this("Margherita", 6.99);
  }
}`

This also brings up something very important about the `this` keyword.

The value of the `this` keyword in static methods is the class itself, since the static method belongs to the class.

That's why we can use `this` to create a new instance of the `Pizza` class.

If you call this method on the `Pizza` class itself and assign the returned instance to a variable, like in this example:

`let myPizza = Pizza.createMargherita();`

You can use it wherever you need to in your code. For example, you can print it to the console:

`console.log(myPizza);`

This is the output:

`Pizza { type: 'Margherita', price: 6.99 }`

You can also use dot notation to call its methods and access its properties, like this:

`console.log(myPizza.type);`

Here is the full example:

`class Pizza {
  constructor(type, price) {
    this.type = type;
    this.price = price;
  }

  static createMargherita() {
    return new this("Margherita", 6.99);
  }
}

let myPizza = Pizza.createMargherita();

console.log(myPizza);
console.log(myPizza.type);`

## Defining and Accessing Static Properties

In addition to methods, you can also define static properties with the `static` keyword.

In this example, we have a static `numberOfPizzasSold` property.

`class Pizza {
  static numberOfPizzasSold = 0;

  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
    Pizza.numberOfPizzasSold++;
  }
}`

It's static because it doesn't belong to any particular pizza instance, it belongs to the class itself.

It has an initial value of `0` and it's updated every time a new instance is created.

If you create two pizza instances, the value will be updated twice:

`let pizza1 = new Pizza("Margherita");
let pizza2 = new Pizza("Neapolitan");`

To access the value of a static property, you just need to use dot notation on the class itself, since the property belongs to the class.

`class Pizza {
  static numberOfPizzasSold = 0;

  constructor(type) {
    this.type = type;
    Pizza.numberOfPizzasSold++;
  }
}

let pizza1 = new Pizza("Margherita");
let pizza2 = new Pizza("Neapolitan");

console.log(Pizza.numberOfPizzasSold);`

In this case, the output is `2` because two pizzas were sold.

These are the fundamentals of static properties and methods in JavaScript. Understanding static members is essential for creating reusable and efficient classes.
